# CircuitPython-Badge-Reverse-Pong-Game

This is a simple example game. It's like the classic pong, but you play as the ball instead of a paddle. Your job is to guide the ball up and down using the d-pad as needed to make sure you hit the paddles.

The game is broken into two files: 

 - code.py - contains the main loop, screen setup, and high-level game updating
 - pong_helpsers.py - contains some helper objects for the game elements. code.py imports, creates, and updates these objects to make the game chooch.
